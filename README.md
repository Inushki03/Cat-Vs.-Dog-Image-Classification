###🐱🐶 Cat vs. Dog Image Classification###

This project is a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation to classify images of cats and dogs.

📌 Project Overview
    The model is trained to distinguish between cats (label = 1) and dogs (label = 0).
It uses separate datasets for:
      Training → training inputs & outputs
      Testing → testing inputs & outputs
The project demonstrates a basic deep learning pipeline using TensorFlow and Keras.

⚙️ Technologies Used
      TensorFlow & Keras → building and training the CNN
      NumPy & Pandas → data handling and preprocessing
      Matplotlib → visualization of images and results

🧠 Model Details
      Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
      Activation Functions:
          ReLU → hidden layers
          Sigmoid → output layer (binary classification)
          Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy

Output:
    0 → Dog 🐶
    1 → Cat 🐱

📊 Results
    Training and validation accuracy/loss can be visualized using Matplotlib.
    Final model achieves accuracy of around 0.66%.
